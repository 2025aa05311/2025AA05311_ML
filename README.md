The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning system that classifies red wine quality as either "Good" or "Bad" based on its physicochemical properties. By implementing and comparing six distinct classification algorithms, we aim to identify the most reliable model to assist winemakers in automated quality assessment and consistency.
